        <h5>About Me</h5>
        <p>
          For nearly a decade, Iâ€™ve spent my career focusing my creative energy in the fashion industry. Recent
          experiences with family and friends suffering from potentially life threatening illnesses have pushed me to
          want to use my design skills for a greater good. I have also witnessed first hand how a family member's work
          in the medical research field has benefited the community and pushed me to reach for my goals. My background
          in design has given me the edge to think of innovative solutions to problems that effect our every day lives.
