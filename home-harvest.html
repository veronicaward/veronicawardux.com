    </div>

    <p>
      I interviewed Ben several times and asked him a series of open-ended questions. After the interviews I was able to
      decipher that Ben had a great passion for gardening but had trouble keeping up with his plants. He found himself
      forgetting to harvest his plants which was extremely important to him. Ben went on to explain that it was
      difficult to keep track of his plants; especially in conjunction with the unpredictable Seattle weather.
      He never knew when to expect frost. Gardening is one of Ben's favorite hobbies and should bring him joy, not
      pain-points.

    <ul>
      <li>
        Fully immersed myself in the goals, needs, and frustrations of a gardener
      </li>

      <li>
        Conducted secondary research by reading and watching tutorial videos on how to grow tomatoes and other various herbs, flowers, and vegetables
      </li>

      <li>  
        Interviewed gardening enthusiasts to gather more data on what it takes to have a successful garden

      <span>Paper Prototyping</span>
    </div>

    <p>
      I sketched rough drafts and conducted user tests with the paper prototype. The testing led to the discovery that
      I was overlooking some valuable information such as how to enter your garden location. This sent me back to
      sketching.

      <span>User Testing and Iterations</span>
    </div>

    <p>
      After re-sketching I began to feel comfortable enough to bring the prototype to life. I created a quick clickable
      proto and tested again. Testing unveiled that there were even more gardening variables that I hadn't accounted for;
      such as what stage of growth the plants are in. Upon discovering this, I decided to conduct more secondary
      research and edited the design again to reflect this new found knowledge.
