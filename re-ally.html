      <span>Research</span>
    </div>

    <div class="text-align">
      Because Re-Ally takes users from apartment search to apartment living we researched users from both ends of the spectrum. We asked open ended questions to find out what their true goals were when shopping for an apartment. We also inquired about their relationship with their apartment manager. It was important to know how effective the communication was (from renter to apartment manager) throughout the entire process.

      <span>The Solution</span>
    </div>

      <div class="text-align">
       Interviews with renters who fit the persona unveiled that users wanted a solution to store all of their apartment searches in one spot so they don't have to look around for emails from apartment managers. Renters wanted the freedom to be able to apply to multiple places for free and not have to pay for multiple credit checks only to be turned down by an apartment. They wanted to feel comfortable contacting their apartment manager, users didn't like the idea that they were constantly bothering their apartment manager for everything. They wanted to make sure they could connect with them and have it be casual, not a formal phone call. Users also wanted a way to see if their roommate had paid rent. Users went into detail about having unfamilar roommates, this was alarming because when your roommate doesn’t pay rent it can affect your credit score. Users needed to feel comfortable knowing what their roommate was paying.

      <span>Paper Prototyping</span>
    </div>

    <div class="text-align">
      After researching and developing a persona and outlining the goals of the renter we felt confident moving forward with rough sketches. We mocked up a number of sketches that we felt catered to the solutions the renter needed based on user interviews. We then brought the sketches to our stakeholder and edited the design based on their business goals (all while keeping the persona's goals/needs in mind).

      <span>User Testing and Iterations</span>
    </div>

    <div class="text-align">
     Upon agreeing on a design strategy with our stakeholder, we then put our design into a low fidelity prototype using Axure. Once we felt confident that enough information was included in our proto we then proceeded to test. We quickly discovered that users did not like to be overwhelmed with information on their dashboard, they wanted the top priority information only.
     We also discovered that users were not excited about the idea of seeing the weather on the dashboard (an idea purposed by the stakeholder).

      <span>Contextual Inquiry</span>
    </div>

    <div class="text-align">
      One theme amoung users that seemed to be important was creating work orders. Every renter wanted to create work orders but had no effective way to submit them, this left many users avoiding the process entirely which can lead to further damage of the property. I decided it would be effective to watch a user utilize their current renter dashboard and have them create a work order. Upon doing this I discovered that most users did not know how to create a work order and had to search their inbox for instructions. After discovering this I decided to swap out the "Neighborhood Perks" section with "Work Orders" to fit the needs of the end user.
