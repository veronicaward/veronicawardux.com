    </div>

    <div class="text-align">
      Lowe's partnered with Fellow Robots to develop a customer service robot that helps shoppers navigate the store. The robot guides the customer to the location of the item and if the shopper has a specific question about a project or tool they can be connected to a service professional through the screen that is located on the front of the robot.
      Lowe's wants to free up employees' time to focus on more one on one customer service. Lowebot is there to help customers as well as employees of Lowe's.

      <span>Research</span>
    </div>

    <div class="text-align">
     In order to become more familiar with Lowebot and how customers are currently reacting to the bot, we called the current store that is housing Lowebot. We quickly found out that many customers were not engaging Lowebot as much as they hoped. Our research uncovered that the number one question being asked to Lowebot was "Where is the bathroom?". Customers weren't taking advantage of the amazing capabilities of Lowebot, nor were they even aware of what Lowebot could even do. We concluded that in order to educate customers on what Lowebot can do we needed to create an app that made Lowebot fun and easy to understand.

    <div class="text-align">
      Once we knew what the persona needed we started sketching rough drafts of the prototype and began testing. After testing we found that there were so many features and screens that users were getting confused and lost within the app. With the whole purupse of the app being to simplify things with Lowebot, we realized we needed to scale back and make the process much less complex.

    </div>

    <div class="text-align">
         Upon testing our high fidelity mock up we discovered that users weren't reading through the FAQ page. Another large problem was that many users couldn't identify what the "summon" button did. The icon wasn't distinct enough for a large number of people to instantly identify. Many users were also alarmed at the idea of accidently hitting the "summon" button and sending the robot unintentionally.

      <span>Final Iteration</span>

    <div class="text-align">
      In our final iteration we chose to include a video of a customer interacting with the robot, a short informative tutorial of what the app can do. Supplying the video as well as the text helped users figure out what their next steps were once entering the app.
      We chose to replace the summon button with a map icon on the FAQ page. The map icon would then take you to the store map with the location of you and Lowebot. Within this page you can then summon Lowebot by hitting the "Summon Lowebot" button.

   <div class="text-align">
      After launching the app the next steps would be to observe and document how customers are interacting with Lowebot. We need to know if customers are learning how to use Lowebot (through the app My Lil' Lowebot), are the interactive controls engaging enough to keep customers coming back. Once we have the data we can then focus more attention on what voice controls are most frequently used and cater more to the persona.
